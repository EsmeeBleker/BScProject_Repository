Will you collect or generate data that is suitable for reuse?
  Yes. 
  
Where will the data be stored during the research?
  Data will be stored on my computer in a folder named Bachelorproject. 
 
After the project has been completed, how will the data be stored for the long-term and made available for use by third parties? To whom will the data be accessible?
  The project does not include a component in which empirical or experimental data are collected, but instead consists of the numerical analysis of mathematical models
  for the population dynamics of host populations, their parasites and predators. R code implementing the model equations, files documenting the parameter choices for
  analysis and scripts generating the figures with model results will all be stored in a public repository on Github or Bitbucket
