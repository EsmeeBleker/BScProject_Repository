-2 parameter bifurcation energetic costs and infection rate
  2-parameter bifurcation graph over infection rate and energetic costs. 2 parameter bifurcation run using 'Bifurcation script juvenile parasitism model with predation.R',
  graph compiled using saved lines from Bifurcation script (second BP) and imported values from IEcurve.dat (first BP) with '2 parameter graph script juvenile model with
  predation.R'.
